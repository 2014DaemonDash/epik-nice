<p>
We are team Epik Nice!!! 8) and we have decided to create a web application
that would allow users to calculate how much vampire power they have built up.
This "vampire power" is also known as leaking energy in which many electric gadgets
waste power by just being plugged in to an outlet.
</p>
<p>
We also provide a program that would monitor several devices using statistical analysis 
and would help the user be more sustainable by alerting them using the SMS Gateway when 
their device has been fully charged. This would help reduce building vampire power.
